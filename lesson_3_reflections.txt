When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

* clone: To copy a remote or local repository to local
* branch: To separate my nexte changes from the actual branch
* fork: To copy someone else's repository to my GitHub account

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
